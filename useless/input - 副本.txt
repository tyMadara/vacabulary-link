The HZMB, adopting Chinese standards in multiple fields, has set an example for high-quality infrastructure construction, said Su Quanke, a member of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on the sidelines of the two sessions, China¡¯s top legislative and political advisory bodies.
Su, also the chief engineer of the HZMB Authority, introduced that 61 volumes of technical standards have been established during the construction of the mega-bridge to ensure world-class quality. ¡°These standard volumes, if piled up, are as high as over one meter,¡± the chief engineer said.
A major achievement in the construction of the bridge is that China has exported many of its technologies and standards, Su said.For example, the constructor of an 18-km immersed tunnel connecting Denmark with Germany under the Fehmarn Belt has visited China four or five times for technical exchanges.
