steel bridges from Germany, Serbia and Norway have signed contracts with Chinese enterprises, hoping the latter to offer Chinese technologies and materials produced on the same production line of the HZMB, Su said. The production line has already started manufacturing for foreign constructors a couple of years ago, and the orders are still coming in till today.
What made Su proud is that he was contacted by the International Tunnelling and Underground Space Association, and the latter expressed its hope to promote Chinese standards internationally.
Su said that more bridges would be built in accordance with Chinese standards around the world in the future.
